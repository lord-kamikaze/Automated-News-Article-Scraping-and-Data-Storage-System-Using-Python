Barron Trump , the 18-year-old son of former President Donald Trump , made a striking entrance on his first day at New York University . The towering figure, standing at 6-foot-7, was seen arriving at the prestigious downtown Manhattan campus amid a flurry of curiosity and intrigue.In newly surfaced photos, Barron, clad in a casual white polo shirt, black pants, and classic Adidas Gazelle sneakers, stood out not just for his height but also for his composed demeanor.The young Trump, carrying a black Swiss Gear backpack, was flanked by his Secret Service detail, highlighting the heightened security measures surrounding him.As Barron made his way to the campus, his first destination was the dean’s office, suggesting a formal start to his academic journey, reported the New York Post. Afterward, he was escorted to his classes, hinting that he might be living off-campus and commuting daily from the Trump Tower in Midtown, rather than staying in the dormitories.While Barron’s exact major remains under wraps, there are strong indications he will be attending the Stern School of Business, as reported by the Daily Mail. His father, Donald Trump, revealed in an interview that Barron was drawn to NYU for its high quality and reputation. "It's a very high-quality place. He liked it. He liked the school," Trump said, noting that although Wharton was also considered, the decision ultimately favored Stern.The presence of Barron’s Secret Service agents has raised questions about the impact on campus security and whether other students will experience any changes due to this heightened protection.
