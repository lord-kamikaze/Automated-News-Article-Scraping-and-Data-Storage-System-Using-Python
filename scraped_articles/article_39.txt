Former first lady Melania Trump on Thursday released an official teaser for her upcoming memoir , titled "Melania”, in a black-and-white video shared on X and said that after years of "public scrutiny and misrepresentation," it’s time for her to set “the truth” free.Describing the writing process as "a deeply personal and reflective journey," Melania said, “I believe it is important to share my perspective: the truth.”“Writing this memoir has been a deeply personal and reflective journey for me,” the wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on X and shared her experience of penning her memoir.“As a private person, who has often been the subject of personal scrutiny and misrepresentation, I feel a responsibility to clarify the facts,” she added.According to the Daily Beast, the upcoming release of her autobiographical book is slated for September 24, a mere two months before the crucial November presidential election , despite her usual stance of being a “private person”, the former First Lady is determined to seize control of her own story and present her perspective to the public.The Slovenian-American former fashion model’s memoir offers a more budget-friendly option, with a signed “Collector’s Edition” priced at $150, and this edition is “printed on premium art paper with a custom white binding,” and features “black foil accents, embossing, and a ribbon marker.”There is limited information available on the site as to what the memoir will cover, though a brief description on the site hints that: “Melania is the powerful and inspiring story of a woman who has defined personal excellence, overcome adversity, and carved her own path. The former First Lady offers readers an intimate look into her world, revealing the extraordinary life she has lived.”According to the publisher, the book will feature "stories and images never before shared with the public," the New York Post reported.Despite resenting previous claims that she is “shy,” as noted by Washington Post journalist Mary Jordan’s The Art of Her Deal, Melania has remained elusive to the public throughout her husband's political career.Melania has chosen to maintain a lower public profile compared to previous First Ladies, making fewer appearances than is customary. This approach has persisted even as her husband, Donald Trump, engages in a presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris Despite reported pleas from several people within Trumpworld, Melania declined to deliver a speech at the Republican National Convention in July, instead, she opted to join her husband in their VIP box.Former White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, who has become a vocal critic of Trump, recently reasserted his earlier statements that Melania "hates" her husband and wants him to lose in November, Daily Beast reported.Journalist Victoria Brownworth in late August 2024 said on X, “Imagine that the lady who was furious she didn't get a Vogue cover as First Lady has a memoir with no photo of her on the cover like in every other memoir in history. It's a low-budget right-wing publisher, but still--couldn't Trump have sprung for a photo cover for his 3rd wife?”The release of "Melania" coincides with a period when her husband is under scrutiny for promoting an eclectic range of merchandise, including footwear, fragrances, and collectible cards, seemingly for his own financial benefit.
