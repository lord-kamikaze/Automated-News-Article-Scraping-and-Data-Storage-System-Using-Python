NEW DELHI: The Gautam Gambhir era in Indian cricket began with the Sri Lanka tour, where India won the T20I series but lost the ODI series. After a break, the Indian team is preparing for a Test series against Bangladesh starting September 19. Rishabh Pant , Indiaâ€™s star wicketkeeper-batsman, shared his thoughts on the changes under Gambhir's leadership. Both have represented Delhi at the national level.In an interview with Jio Cinema, Pant was asked about the biggest shift in Indian cricket under Gambhir."Rahul bhai was very balanced as a person and a coach, which has its pros and cons. It depends on individuals whether to focus on the positives or negatives," Pant said."Gauti bhai is more aggressive, focused solely on winning. But it's crucial to find the right balance and improve," Pant further said.Pant also stressed the importance of not underestimating Bangladesh, especially after their recent 2-0 Test series victory over Pakistan in Rawalpindi."Asian teams like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka excel in familiar conditions. As the Indian team, we focus on maintaining our standards and playing with the same intensity, regardless of the opposition," Pant said.The first Test between India and Bangladesh will be held at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, while the second match will take place at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur from September 27 onwards.
