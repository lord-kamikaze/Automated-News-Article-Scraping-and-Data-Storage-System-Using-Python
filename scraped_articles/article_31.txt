A new era of fitness begins with him leading the way!" the MCA wrote alongside the pictures.This workout session comes as Sharma gears up for a crucial Test season, with India looking to make a strong start in their red-ball assignments .The veteran opener, known for his class and experience, was last seen in action during India's three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in August. Sharma was the standout performer for the visitors, scoring 58, 64, and 35 across the series.Despite Sharma's consistent form, India lost the series 2-0, marking Sri Lanka’s first ODI series win over India in 27 years.
