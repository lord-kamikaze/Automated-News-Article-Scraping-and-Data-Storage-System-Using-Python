Supported really well by Navdeep Saini. Duty ke baad roz practice, jitna duty utna practice #DuleepTrophy2024," Suryakumr wrote on his social media handle.Musheer, the younger brother of Sarfaraz Khan , exhibited an unconventional but effective technique, often walking down the track to counter the movement of the ball.He displayed elegance through a well-timed on-drive off Avesh Khan and a powerful cut off left-arm seamer Khaleel Ahmed.Musheer also showcased his power by hitting spinner Tanush Kotian for two sixes in an over.Despite being dropped by Avesh on 69, Musheer made the most of the opportunity, reaching his century off 205 balls with a single off Kuldeep Yadav.Despite the setbacks, the Musheer-Saini stand revived India B's innings, giving them hope as the match progresses.
