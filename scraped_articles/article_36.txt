Former US President Donald Trump has once again dismissed the global threat of climate change , claiming that concerns about rising sea levels are overblown. He claimed that the ocean would only "go down 100th of an inch within the next 400 years" and argued that this is not a pressing issue.While campaigning in New York city, Trump said, “When people talk about global warming , I say the ocean is going to go down 100th of an inch within the next 400 years.That’s not our problem,”Referring to "nuclear warming" as the real problem, Trump added, “Our problem is nuclear warming , and we better be smart, and we better have smart people at the top who know how to deal. Because these people don’t know how to deal.”Trump for long has dismissed the scientific consensus on global warming, which has been largely attributed to the burning of fossil fuels . His remarks mark a sharp contrast to the current administration’s climate policies.Throughout his political career, Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on climate change, famously referring to it as a “hoax.” His administration, during his first term, was characterized by a rollback ofenvironmental regulations , favoring oil and gas drilling.Trump’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry is well-documented; in recent statements, he has even suggested that fossil fuel executives should raise $1 billion for his presidential campaign, promising in return to unleash further oil and gas drilling and cut environmental regulations.“If Donald Trump wins the upcoming US presidential elections,” analysts predict, “it could mean the swift dismantling of many of President Joe Biden’s clean energy rules,” as his campaign suggested last week.One of Trump’s most controversial moves during his first term was pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement, a global pact aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming. Trump argued that the deal was unfair to the US, favoring countries like China and costing American jobs. In contrast, President Biden, upon taking office, quickly re-entered the US into the agreement. Trump, if re-elected, is set to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement once again.
