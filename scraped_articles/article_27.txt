Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly kept his two sons hidden from the public eye for years, treating their existence as a closely guarded state secret.Recent revelations by a Russian investigative journalism website have shed light on Putin's long-rumored relationship with former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva.The Dossier Center reported that the couple has two sons, Ivan, 9, and Vladimir Jr., 5, who reside in a heavily guarded mansion near Lake Valdai, north-west of Moscow.The boys live an isolated life of luxury, surrounded by nannies, governesses, and personal trainers, and are protected by the Kremlin's Federal Protective Service. They have never attended school and are instead educated by a team of private tutors.The young Putins' lives are shrouded in secrecy, with their identities hidden from official databases and their birth dates known only to close relatives.Kabaeva gave birth to Ivan in a private Swiss clinic in 2015, while Vladimir Jr. was born in Moscow in 2019. The Russian-born gynaecologist who delivered both boys passed away last year under mysterious circumstances.Despite their privileged upbringing, the boys lead a sheltered existence, with limited opportunities for social interaction. They have an extensive collection of toys and pets but can only play with each other or the adults in their household, the Daily Mail reported.Putin occasionally plays ice hockey with Ivan but always on the same team. The boys follow a strict daily routine, with meals prepared by personal chefs and served by dedicated waiters. They have access to private gym facilities and swimming pools, with personal coaches for each activity.The young Putins spend their summers on luxury yachts in the Gulf of Finland and the Black Sea coast, accompanied by their teachers and staff. They travel exclusively by private jet or armored train. Their parents have sought English teachers from countries sympathetic to Russia , with staff required to live in isolation and undergo a two-week quarantine before starting work.Putin has at least three other children, including two adult daughters from his previous marriage and a love-child from an affair with a cleaner. The intense secrecy surrounding his sons with Kabaeva may stem from his background as a former KGB officer, his sensitivity about his relationship with Kabaeva, and heightened security concerns following the Ukraine invasion.The revelations about Putin's sons have been met with mixed reactions from the Russian public, particularly as the country grapples with the loss of tens of thousands of its own sons in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
