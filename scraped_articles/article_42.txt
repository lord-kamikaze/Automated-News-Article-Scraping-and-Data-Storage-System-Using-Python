SHIMLA: A large number of protesters demonstrated in Sanjauli market of Shimla Thursday, demanding demolition of a mosque that has been at the centre of a heated debate surrounding the legality of its construction and illegal immigrants allegedly staying there."If the building is found to be illegal, action will be taken," PWD minister Vikramaditya Singh assured."The presence of immigrants is a concern for the people of Himachal Pradesh ."Singh said the matter is pending before the municipal commissioner's court, with a hearing scheduled for Sept 7.The four-hour demonstration saw participation from residents, BJP workers, and members of several organisations, who shouted slogans against the alleged illegal mosque . Authorities deployed a large police team to prevent any violence . Shimla DC Anupam Kashyap said the administration was holding discussions with both communities to ensure peace.The mosque's construction became a flashpoint last week after an altercation between a man and a barber from minority community. It has been alleged that the man slapped the barber and the latter's friends assaulted him, resulting in head wounds that required a dozen stitches.The mosque triggered a debate in the state assembly Wednesday. Panchayati Raj minister Anirudh Singh said the mosque's legality has been under review since 2010, with over 44 hearings till date."Despite this, construction was carried out illegally. When citizens violate regulations, they face immediate action, so why has this issue been overlooked for so long? Illegal is illegal, whether it's a temple or a mosque," Singh remarked.
