What are the issues with Boeing

Ninety-three days after launching aboard, Boeing's Starliner capsule is prepared to undock from the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday evening leaving Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams , the two astronauts who have been on the ISS since June, to remain on the station as the capsule departs.The hatch of the Starliner was closed, and the capsule was prepared for re-entry on Thursday at 1.29 pm ET (September 5, 10.59 pm IST), marking the final stage of a challenging test flight that has been less than satisfactory.The Starliner spacecraft is set to undock from the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, September 6, at approximately 6.04 pm EDT (September 7, 3.30 am IST), leaving astronauts Wilmore and Williams behind. Approximately six hours after undocking, the Starliner is anticipated to land at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico at around 12.03 am EDT on Saturday, September 7, marking the conclusion of its flight test.Following the undocking procedure, Starliner will execute a forceful "breakout burn" to propel itself a safe distance away from the station. This maneuver is a precautionary measure to eliminate any risk of collision, which would have been unnecessary if a crew were present to assume manual control of the vehicle if required, AFP reported.The general consensus is that Starliner will successfully complete its landing, utilizing parachutes and airbags for assistance, mirroring its performance during two prior un crewed tests conducted in 2019 and 2022.The spacecraft will then initiate its descent back to Earth, with its powerful braking rockets scheduled to fire for approximately 59 seconds, five hours and 15 minutes after undocking, to bring the ship out of orbit.Wilmore and Williams, who will remain on the ISS, are expected to return to Earth in February of next year, aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. The launch of this spacecraft is planned for September 24 and by the time they finally make it back to Earth, the astronauts will have spent an impressive 262 days in space.Earlier on Wednesday, while working inside the Starliner to organize return items and ensure proper balance and center of gravity, Williams said, "it's bittersweet to be packing up Starliner and putting our simulators in our seats. But, you know, we want to do the best we can to make sure she's in good shape," CBS news reported.Williams reassured flight controllers, stating "we'll tidy it all up tomorrow (Thursday), make sure everything's squared away and do a last couple of things for the closeout before hatch closure. Thanks for backing us up, thanks for looking over our shoulder and making sure we've got everything in the right place. We want her to have a nice, soft landing in the desert."Nasa will provide live coverage of the return and related activities on NASA+, the Nasaapp, YouTube, and the agency’s website.5. 45 pm (EDT) (3.45 am (IST) Undocking coverage begins6.04 pm (EDT) (4.04 am IST) Starliner undocks from ISS10.50 pm (EDT) 8.50 am (IST) Coverage resumes for deorbit burn, entry, and landing12.03 am (EDT) ( 5.03 am IST) Targeted landing time1.30 am(EDT) ( 6.30 am IST) Post-landing news conference (live coverage on NA+, the Nasaapp, YouTube, and Nasa's website)Nasa in a statement said that: “Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on June 5 for its first crewed flight, arriving at the International Space Station on June 6. During Starliner’s approach, Nasa and Boeing discovered helium leaks and encountered issues with the spacecraft’s reaction control thrusters.For the safety of the crew, Nasa declared on August 24 that Starliner would return to Earth without its crew. Wilmore and Williams will remain on the ISS and are expected to return in February 2025, alongside two additional crew members from Nasa's SpaceX Crew-9 mission.
